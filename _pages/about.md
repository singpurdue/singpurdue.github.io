## Introduction

Hello! I’m **Amit Singha**, a doctoral student in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus). My research focuses on mmWave-based wireless systems, adversarial machine learning, and privacy/security solutions. I'm also involved with the [Purdue Indy Security Lab](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/people/students/view/3815), working to develop robust, privacy-preserving AI for next-generation wireless technologies.  

I previously served as a Graduate Research Assistant at Purdue University and completed prior doctoral coursework at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). My academic journey includes a Master of Science in Computer Science from Jahangirnagar University (JU) and a Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Engineering from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP).

## Research Overview

- **Adversarial Machine Learning & AI Robustness:** Exploring methods to defend against adversarial label flipping, physical backdoor attacks, and privacy-invasive inference in machine learning models—especially those leveraging mmWave signals.
- **Wireless & Mobile Security:** Investigating novel security protocols for mmWave radar imaging, cryptographic solutions for sensor networks, and data protection for emerging wireless technologies.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Designing autoencoder and diffusion-based data sanitization to prevent sensitive attribute inference while maintaining high activity recognition performance.

## Highlights & Ongoing Work

- **mmWave-based Human Activity Recognition:** Published and under-review works demonstrating both novel attacks (e.g., physical backdoors, universal adversarial perturbations) and robust defenses in black-box settings.
- **Lightweight Cryptography & Steganography:** Developed secure text-steganographic methods leveraging Bengali Unicode & whitespace characters, as well as cryptographic schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks in agriculture.

## Teaching & Mentoring

Currently, I serve as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus), instructing MATLAB-based engineering coursework. In the past, I’ve also taught undergraduate-level programming and mathematics, and I continuously mentor students in topics related to signal processing and AI.
