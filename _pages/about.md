## Introduction :wave:

Hello! I am **Amit Singha** :graduation_cap:, a doctoral student in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus). My research centers on mmWave-based wireless systems, adversarial machine learning, and robust, privacy-focused security solutions. I collaborate closely with the [Purdue Indy Security Lab :shield:](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/people/students/view/3815) to develop advanced AI methods that safeguard next-generation wireless technologies.

Prior to my current role, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at Purdue University and completed part of my doctoral coursework at Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). My academic background includes a Master of Science in Computer Science from Jahangirnagar University (JU) and a Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Engineering from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP).

## Research Overview :mag_right:

- **Adversarial Machine Learning & AI Robustness**  
  Investigating strategies to secure machine learning models (especially mmWave-based) against adversarial label flipping, physical backdoors, and privacy-invasive inference.

- **Wireless & Mobile Security**  
  Designing protocols and frameworks for mmWave radar imaging, cryptographic safeguards for sensor networks, and data protection within emerging wireless landscapes.

- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**  
  Developing autoencoder and diffusion-based data sanitization to block sensitive attribute inference while preserving accurate activity recognition.

## Highlights & Ongoing Work :star:

- **mmWave-based Human Activity Recognition**: Contributing novel adversarial attack methods (e.g., universal perturbations) and corresponding defensive strategies under black-box settings.  
- **Lightweight Cryptography & Steganography**: Implementing text-steganographic solutions using Bengali Unicode and whitespace, along with cryptographic schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks in agriculture.

## Teaching & Mentorship :teacher:

I currently serve as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus), focusing on MATLAB-based engineering instruction. Previously, I taught undergraduate-level programming and mathematics, and I continually mentor students in signal processing and AI applications.
