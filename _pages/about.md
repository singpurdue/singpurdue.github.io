## Introduction

Welcome! I am **Amit Singha**, a doctoral student in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus). My research centers on mmWave-based wireless systems, adversarial machine learning, and robust, privacy-focused security solutions. I collaborate closely with the [Purdue Indy Security Lab](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/people/students/view/3815) to develop advanced AI methods that safeguard next-generation wireless technologies.

Prior to my current role, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at Purdue University and completed part of my doctoral coursework at Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). My academic background also includes a Master of Science in Computer Science from Jahangirnagar University (JU) and a Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Engineering from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP).

## Research Overview

- **Adversarial Machine Learning & AI Robustness:**  
  Investigating strategies to secure machine learning models, particularly those harnessing mmWave signals, against adversarial label flipping, physical backdoor attacks, and privacy-invasive inference.

- **Wireless & Mobile Security:**  
  Designing protocols and frameworks for mmWave radar imaging, cryptographic safeguards for sensor networks, and data protection measures tailored to emerging wireless technologies.

- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:**  
  Developing autoencoder and diffusion-based data sanitization approaches to prevent the inference of sensitive attributes while sustaining reliable activity recognition.

## Highlights & Ongoing Work

- **mmWave-based Human Activity Recognition:**  
  Contributing novel adversarial attack methods (e.g., physical backdoors, universal perturbations) and corresponding robust defensive strategies under black-box settings.

- **Lightweight Cryptography & Steganography:**  
  Conceiving text-steganographic solutions that leverage Bengali Unicode and whitespace, as well as cryptographic mechanisms for Wireless Sensor Networks in agriculture.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I currently hold a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** position at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus), focusing on MATLAB-based engineering coursework. I have also taught undergraduate-level programming and mathematics, and continue to mentor students on topics such as signal processing and applied AI.
