## Introduction :wave:

Hello! I am **Amit Singha** :graduation_cap:, a doctoral student at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus). My research centers on mmWave-based wireless systems, adversarial machine learning, and robust, privacy-focused security solutions. I closely collaborate with the [Purdue Indy Security Lab :shield:](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/people/students/view/3815) to advance AI methods safeguarding next-generation wireless technologies.

I have served as a Graduate Research Assistant at Purdue University and completed part of my doctoral coursework at Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). My academic background includes an M.Sc. in Computer Science (Jahangirnagar University) and a B.Sc. in Information and Communication Engineering (BUP).

## Research Overview :mag_right:

- **Adversarial Machine Learning & AI Robustness**  
  Developing strategies to secure mmWave-based ML systems from adversarial label flipping, physical backdoors, and privacy-invasive inference.

- **Wireless & Mobile Security**  
  Designing protocols for mmWave radar imaging, cryptographic safeguards for sensor networks, and data protection for emerging wireless solutions.

- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**  
  Applying autoencoder and diffusion-based methods to sanitize data, preventing sensitive attribute inference while preserving activity recognition accuracy.

## Highlights & Ongoing Work :star:

- **mmWave-based HAR**: Contributing novel adversarial attack methods (e.g., universal perturbations) and robust defenses under black-box conditions.  
- **Lightweight Cryptography & Steganography**: Leveraging Bengali Unicode and whitespace for secure text-steganography; cryptographic approaches for WSN in agriculture.

## Teaching & Mentorship :teacher:

Currently, I am a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus), instructing MATLAB-based engineering coursework. I also mentor students in signal processing and applied AI.
