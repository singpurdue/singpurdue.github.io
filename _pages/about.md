## Introduction :wave:

Hello! I am **Amit Singha**, a doctoral student in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus). My research focuses on mmWave-based wireless systems, adversarial machine learning, and privacy-centric security solutions. I collaborate with the [Purdue Indy Security Lab :shield:](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/people/students/view/3815) to develop robust AI methodologies for next-generation wireless technologies.

Previously, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at Purdue University and completed doctoral coursework at Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). My academic background includes an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Jahangirnagar University (JU) and a B.Sc. in Information and Communication Engineering from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP).

## Research Overview :mag_right:

- **Adversarial Machine Learning & AI Robustness**  
  Investigating techniques to protect mmWave-based ML models from adversarial label flipping, physical backdoor attacks, and privacy-leaking inferences.

- **Wireless & Mobile Security**  
  Creating secure protocols for mmWave radar imaging, cryptographic defenses for sensor networks, and data protection for emerging wireless ecosystems.

- **Privacy-Preserving Approaches**  
  Applying autoencoder and diffusion-based data sanitization to hide sensitive attributes while retaining reliable activity recognition.

## Highlights & Ongoing Work :star:

- **mmWave-based Human Activity Recognition**: Proposing novel universal adversarial attacks and corresponding defenses in black-box settings.  
- **Lightweight Cryptography & Steganography**: Pioneering text-steganographic solutions using Bengali Unicode & whitespace, plus cryptographic frameworks for WSN in agriculture.

## Teaching & Mentorship :teacher:

Currently, I am a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** at Purdue University (Indianapolis Campus), emphasizing MATLAB-based engineering coursework. I have also instructed undergraduate programming, mathematics, and regularly mentor students in signal processing and AI techniques.
