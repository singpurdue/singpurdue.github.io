## My Portfolio

Below are some **selected projects** that demonstrate my work in 
wireless systems, adversarial ML, and software development, 
along with prototypes aimed at practical applications.

## Selected Projects

1. **Deep Dream with VGG16 and DenseNet121** <br>
   *(Mar 2023 – Mar 2023)*  
   - Applied the Deep Dream algorithm with VGG16 and DenseNet121 models to enhance and visualize features in an image of a monkey. 
   - Implemented creative adaptations by guiding the algorithm with images of bananas and cherries for unique, surreal visual effects.

2. **Audio-Effects-Generator** <br>
   *(Aug 2022 – Dec 2022)*  
   - Developed audio effects using input audio processed through a FRDM-K64 board. 
   - Achieved effects like ECHO, REVERB, SLAPBACK, PANNING, and CHORUS. 
   - Utilized Wolfson Pi Audio Card, Keil MDK-ARM, and MATLAB Simulink. 
   - Aimed to extend the project for wireless and IoT applications.

3. **Self Supervised Contrastive Learning in PyTorch** <br>
   *(Oct 2022 – Nov 2022)*  
   - Created a self-supervised learning model for 3D shape representation using the ShapeNet dataset’s point clouds. 
   - Employed PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, and DynamicEdgeConv, with InfoNCE/NT-Xent loss for contrastive learning. 
   - Achieved effective representation and separation of entities in the embedding space.

4. **End-to-End Deep Learning for Potato Blight Disease Classification** <br>
   *(Dec 2021 – Apr 2022)*  
   - Developed a web/mobile application to diagnose potato blight disease using deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks.

5. **RyDE** <br>
   *(Jan 2019 – Jun 2019)*  
   - Created a ride-sharing app featuring live GPS location, integrated rider and user apps. 
   - Utilized Firebase database, Java, and Android Studio to build a functional real-time ride service.

6. **Smart Wheelchair for Disabled People** <br>
   *(Jan 2018 – May 2018)*  
   - Conceptualized a cost-effective smart wheelchair controllable through hand gestures.
   - Aimed at increasing mobility for disabled individuals.
