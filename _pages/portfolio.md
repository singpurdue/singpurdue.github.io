## Selected Projects

1. **Deep Dream with VGG16 and DenseNet121**  
   *(March 2023)*  
   - Implemented Deep Dream algorithms using VGG16 and DenseNet121 to visualize and enhance features in an image of a monkey.  
   - Employed creative adaptations by guiding the algorithm with banana and cherry images to generate surreal effects.

2. **Audio-Effects-Generator**  
   *(August 2022 – December 2022)*  
   - Developed audio effects using input processed by an FRDM-K64 board.  
   - Achieved ECHO, REVERB, SLAPBACK, PANNING, and CHORUS, leveraging Wolfson Pi Audio Card, Keil MDK-ARM, and MATLAB Simulink.  
   - Explored extensions for wireless and IoT contexts.

3. **Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning in PyTorch**  
   *(October 2022 – November 2022)*  
   - Created a self-supervised learning framework for 3D shape representations using ShapeNet point clouds.  
   - Leveraged PyTorch Geometric and DynamicEdgeConv with InfoNCE/NT-Xent loss for robust embedding separation.

4. **End-to-End Deep Learning for Potato Blight Disease Classification**  
   *(December 2021 – April 2022)*  
   - Built a web/mobile application for diagnosing potato blight disease via deep learning and CNNs.

5. **RyDE**  
   *(January 2019 – June 2019)*  
   - Engineered a ride-sharing application featuring live GPS location for riders and drivers.  
   - Utilized Firebase for real-time data management, Java, and Android Studio for front-end implementation.

6. **Smart Wheelchair for Disabled Individuals**  
   *(January 2018 – May 2018)*  
   - Designed a cost-efficient wheelchair controllable through hand gestures.  
   - Focused on improving mobility solutions for users with physical disabilities.
