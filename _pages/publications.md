## Ongoing Research Works

**Funding:** Supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).

- **Universal Physical Adversarial Attacks on mmWave-Based Human Activity Recognition**  
  Investigating black-box universal adversarial attacks by placing optimized reflectors on the human body to induce targeted and untargeted misclassifications.

- **Privacy-Preserving Defense Against Attribute Inference Attacks**  
  Exploring autoencoder and diffusion-based methods that sanitize mmWave-based data, hiding sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, body shape) while retaining activity recognition accuracy.
