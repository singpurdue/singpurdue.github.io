## Note on Publications and Talks

For each of these conferences or symposia, I also have accompanying **published (or under review) papers** listed in the [Publications](/publications/) section.  
Since *in every conference* my paper was accepted or published, I presented the work either as a **talk** or a **poster** (offline or online).
